Let's perform the following commands:

First, we'll simply try
1. vsce package

If we don't have all the dependencies, we can do the following:
1. npm install -f @vscode/vsce
2. vsce package

This will create a .vsix file that can be installed in VSCode.

To install the extension:
1. code --install-extension cline-*.vsix

Note: Make sure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json before packaging.
