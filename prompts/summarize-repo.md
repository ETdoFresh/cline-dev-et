**Task Overview:** The task is to generate a README file for a repository by analyzing each file within the repository, summarizing its purpose and functionality, and then creating an overview. The README should explain what each file and part does in simple terms, with each file described in one or a few bullet points.

**Steps to Generate README:**

1. **Create a SUMMARY.md:** Start by creating a `SUMMARY.md` file. Do not overwrite previous entries in `SUMMARY.md`; always append new information to preserve all historical summaries. As you analyze each file, append your summaries to `SUMMARY.md` to keep track of internal memory and maintain an organized collection of information.

1. **Analyze Each File:** Review the contents of each file in the repository. Take note of the main purpose, key functions, classes, or other relevant elements.

2. **Summarize Internally:** As you summarize each file, add the information to `SUMMARY.md` without overwriting previous summaries to maintain a cumulative record. Create a brief internal summary of each file. Focus on its main purpose, usage, and the most important functionality it provides.

3. **Write the Overview:** Compile the internal summaries into a cohesive README. The README should:
   - Begin with a high-level description of the project.
   - Include a section listing each file, with a simple bullet-point description of its role.
   - Be written in clear, concise language to make it accessible to users of all levels.

**Structure of the README:**

- **Project Overview:** A brief description of what the project does, its main features, and any notable technologies or tools used.

- **File Descriptions:** Each file should have a simple bullet-point description, organized in a logical manner (e.g., grouped by functionality or importance). Example:
  - **`main.py`**: Initializes the project and starts the main process.
  - **`utils/helpers.py`**: Contains helper functions for data formatting and logging.
  - **`config.yaml`**: Configuration file for setting environment variables.

**Content Guidelines:**

- **Simplicity:** Descriptions should be easy to understand, avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent formatting, terminology, and structure for each description.
- **Clarity:** The purpose of each file should be clearly communicated, allowing any reader to quickly understand the role of each part.

**Comments:** The README should be written to be informative without unnecessary detail. Aim to provide just enough context to understand each part without overwhelming the reader.
